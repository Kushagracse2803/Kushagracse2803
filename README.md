# Hello, I'm Kushagra Tiwari! 👋

I am an enthusiastic **LLM/ML Engineer** specializing in end-to-end Python machine learning pipelines (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn). I focus on developing, optimizing, and deploying production-ready models via Flask/REST APIs. I am the creator of a custom GPT-style architecture, the Elysium LLM, and multi-LLM routing systems using Hugging Face and LangChain.
